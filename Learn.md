Welcome to our Job Portal Project! This project aims to create a user-friendly platform for job seekers to find employment opportunities and for employers to post job listings. Below you'll find information on how to set up and run the project, as well as an overview of its features.

## Features:

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Job seekers and employers can register and log in securely to access the portal's features.

2. **Job Listings**: Employers can post job listings, including job titles, descriptions, requirements, and contact information.

3. **Job Search**: Job seekers can search for job listings based on various criteria such as job title, location, and keywords.

4. **Filters and Sorting**: Users can filter and sort job listings based on different parameters to find relevant opportunities efficiently.

5. **Application Management**: Job seekers can apply to job listings directly through the portal, and employers can manage received applications.

6. **User Profiles**: Both job seekers and employers have profiles where they can manage their information, including resumes, job preferences, and company details.

7. **Notifications**: Users receive notifications for important events such as new job listings, application status updates, and messages from employers.
